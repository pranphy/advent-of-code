# Advent of Code
This is my attempt to solve the advent of code problems. My initial goal is to learn a new language `julia` more than to collect stars for the solution of problems. I am hoping that along the way my understanding of problem solving techniques will be better and I learn something new besides programming and problem solving.

# Choice of julia
I have heard a lot about `julia` programming language but have not done any coding on it. I think this is a good opporunity to learn it while also being in a challenge.

# Motivation
Programming is generally a fun thing to do for me. Having a good break from my day to day work and utilizing the break time to think about the problems and implementing in julia might be refresshing (I hope).


# Anything Else
No.
